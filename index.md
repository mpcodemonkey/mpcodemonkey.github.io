##Introduction
Welcome to my project site! My name is Jonathan Tinney, and I'm currently finishing up my Master's Degree in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento. I have a few years of experience in writing Java applications, but am currently branching out to JavaScript via WebGL to work on a web based game engine for my master's project. My specialty is in game engineering, but I have also dabbled in software engineering, as well as a bit of cyber security.

## Current Projects
* [MVRE](https://mpcodemonkey.github.io/mvre/), a WebGL based game engine that supports VR
* [SGLP](https://mpcodemonkey.github.io/sglp/), a game launching platform for the SAGE engine

## Previous Projects
* [Transparency-Demo](https://mpcodemonkey.github.io/transparency-demo/), a demo of the transparency functions supported by SAGE
* [Statboost](https://mpcodemonkey.github.io/statboostv2/), an E-commerce website for Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh card sales
* [ygodbbuilder](https://mpcodemonkey.github.io/ygodbbuilder/), a card attribute and image parser for db.yugioh-card.com and yugioh.wikia.com
* [planechase](https://mpcodemonkey.github.io/planechase/), a graphical implementation of planechase for android
